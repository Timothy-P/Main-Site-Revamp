# Welcome
This is going to be my new primary site once it is finished. It generally follows a Windows 95 theme, as I believe you don't need something modern to have something cool.

As for the features, it's gonna take a while, so stay tuned.

# Overview
This is probably my most ambitious project yet, other than my project about [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Timothy-P/Game). There's a lot I plan on doing, so there's no point in saying, "He'll give up in a couple of weeks," because I enjoy this.

# Features
I plan on having it move the icons, double click to open a window, and allow you to navigate a filesystem of sorts. Of course there's going to be a taskbar, but the other parts have me plenty preoccupied.

# Minor Issues
While working and showing friends what I've been doing, I noticed that on my low-resource computer, it didn't work as well. So as a recommendation, try to have more CPU and RAM power on standby than a small amount.

The help icon does work now. However, as I have done, I forgot to upload the image for the delete button, so it'll just be the standard default for now.

# Thank You
And thank you for reading this. It hasn't taken a lot of time to get here, so the most I can ask of you is to stick around.
