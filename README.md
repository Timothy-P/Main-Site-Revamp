# Welcome
This is going to be my new primary site once it is finished. It generally follows a Windows 95 theme, as I believe you don't need something modern to have something cool.

As for the features, it's gonna take a while, so stay tuned.

# Overview
This is probably my most ambitious project yet, other than my project about [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/Timothy-P/Game). There's a lot I plan on doing, so there's no point in saying, "He'll give up in a couple of weeks," because I enjoy this.

# Features
- Desktop
- Icons on desktop (which are moveable)
- Draggable menus
- Functional filesystem

# Minor Issues
The help icon does work now. However, as I have done, I forgot to upload the image for the delete button, so it'll just be the standard default for now.

Mobile doesn't work/react well. It relies on something entirely different from PC, so I'll impliment touch controls when I get everything else finished.

# Newest update
I just uploaded (probably) a hundred lines, so it'll be a bit harder on a computer to run, but it's a really light project, so most if not all computers should run it fine.

I also got the taskbar framework going, so that's good. I have a decent context menu (thank [Stephan Stanisic](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3836130/stephan-stanisic) and [Phillip Senn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/111665/phillip-senn) for [the code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4909167/how-to-add-a-custom-right-click-menu-to-a-webpage#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20answers%20here%20and%20on%20other) on StackOverflow!) going, but nothing works, so stay tuned.

# Thank You
And thank you for reading this. It hasn't taken a lot of time to get here, so the most I can ask of you is to stick around.
