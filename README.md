# Welcome
This is going to be my new primary site once it is finished. It generally follows a Windows 95 theme, as I believe you don't need something modern to have something cool.

As for the features, it's gonna take a while, so stay tuned.

# Features
I plan on having it move the icons, double click to open a window, and allow you to navigate a filesystem of sorts. Of course there's going to be a taskbar, but the other parts have me plenty preoccupied.

# Minor Issues
While working and showing friends what I've been doing, I noticed that on my low-resource computer, it didn't work as well. So as a recommendation, try to have more CPU and RAM power on standby than a small amount.

The help icon doesn't work, as I'm trying to get the styling for the menus working. Once I do get it working, I'll put it here.

# Thank You
And thank you for reading this. It hasn't taken a lot of time to get here, so the most I can ask of you is to stick around.
